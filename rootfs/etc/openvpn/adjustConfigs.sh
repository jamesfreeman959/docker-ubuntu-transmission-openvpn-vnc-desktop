# This is a script to ease the process of updating and adding .ovpn files to the project.
# As some customizations have to be done with the .ovpn files from the providers
# this script was created to make it easy and also to highlight which changes we actually do and why.
#
# Intended usage is to download .zip (or other) package with .ovpn files from your provider.
# Then delete the content in the provider-folder, replace with the new ones, run the script and it should be quite good.
# Just need to double check that the default.ovpn is still there and that the diff to origin looks reasonable.
